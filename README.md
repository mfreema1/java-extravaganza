# Me Learning Java

I'm not really a Java person, but it's probably time that I changed that.  I'm learning Java from two sources right now:
- Tim Buchalka on Udemy (great videos)
- Interview Cake

I'll be taking a fairly intense course this upcoming semester almost entirely in Java, so we'll see how well that goes.  It will be up on my GitHub as well -- feel free to check it out if you'd like.
